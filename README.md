# Predicting-Molecular-Solubility
This Python program uses a linear regression model to predict the aqueous solubility (logS) of molecules from molecular descriptors such as molecular weight, aromatic proportion, number of rotatable bonds, and MolLogP. Includes data exploration, training/testing split, and visualization of predicted versus actual values.
